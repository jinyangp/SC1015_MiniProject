## Notes:

1) Dataset is too big to be pushed to Github. In the future, can just push our notebooks into Github while the dataset can be kept on our local computers.
2) To keep the main branch as lean as possible, lets work in our individual branches first and once we are ready to merge, we can then merge our work into the Main.ipynb notebook in the main branch
